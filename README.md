Prototyping SPA-based Reference App.

The initial state is just raw HTML in anticipation of using [fsa-prototype-kit](https://github.com/USDA-FSA/fsa-prototype-kit/).

As such, nothing "builds" to `dist`. So I just run it from `src` like so...

```
npm install -g browser-sync
npm start
```

If that doesn't work, just view `src` locally.
